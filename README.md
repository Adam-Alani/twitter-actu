# twitter-actu
a french xkcd inspired twitter bot. Searches for any article posted by certain twitter accounts and replaces certain words to make news a bit less depressing.

### Contribution
feel free to add more words into the substitution dictionary with the following format:
> oldword, newword

the point is not to have as many replaced words as possible, but to replace as many heavily used words in the news industry
